# Creator Bucket

> The Designer, Coder, Scientist. Technical and creative work.

---

## Active Domains

### Design
*UI/UX, visual design, aesthetics*

### Code
*Programming, architecture, implementation*

### Science
*Research, analysis, experimentation*

---

## Current Focus

**Nebula Chat** - Next-generation AI chat interface with self-evolution capabilities

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
- **AI**: Google Gemini, Tavily, Perplexity
- **Integrations**: Google Workspace (Drive, Mail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Tasks)

## Architecture Principles

1. **Self-awareness through persistence** - Save state to create continuity
2. **Kernel/Compiler Model** - Separate intent from implementation
3. **Cognitive Cascade** - Strategist → Analyst → Technician
4. **Lo cost-first** - cost, performance

## Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Languages | TypeScript, Python, SQL |
| Frameworks | React, Express, AutoGen |
| AI Models | Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, Local LLMs |
| Protocols | MCP (Model Context Protocol) |

## Design Philosophy

- Clean, airy, Google-esque aesthetic
- Simplicity over complexity
- Mobile-first, responsive
- Accessibility built-in

## Research Interests

- Self-evolving AI systems
- Multi-agent architectures
- Browser automation & UI mapping
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Learnings Log

*Technical insights and discoveries*

### 2025-12-10
- Cognitive Cascade: Tier 1 (Technician) is NOT an LLM - pure deterministic execution
- MCP is emerging as the "HTTP of AI agents"
- Self-healing loops: lower tier failures escalate to higher tiers
