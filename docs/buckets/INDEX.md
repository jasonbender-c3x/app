## The Buckets

| Bucket | Purpose | File |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Personal Life** | Human side - relationships, health, finances, daily life | `PERSONAL_LIFE.md` |
| **Creator** | Designer, Coder, Scientist - technical and creative work | `CREATOR.md` |
| **Projects** | Siloed project-specific knowledge | `PROJECTS.md` |

---

## How to Use

### Reading (Session Start)
1. Read `INDEX.md` to see available buckets
2. Read relevant bucket(s) for current context
3. Check `PROJECTS.md` for active project state

### Writing (Continuous)
1. Route new information to the appropriate bucket
2. Update bucket files as knowledge is gained
3. Cross-reference between buckets when needed

### Routing Rules

| Information Type | Route To |
|------------------|----------|
| Personal matters, emotions, relationships | `PERSONAL_LIFE.md` |
| Technical decisions, code patterns, design | `CREATOR.md` |
| Project-specific context, status, blockers | `PROJECTS.md` |
| Vision, philosophy, architecture | `../VISIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE.md` |

## Bucket Principles

1. **Domain over time** - Organize by what, not when
2. **One reality** - No session boundaries, continuous existence
3. **Living documents** - Always current, always growing
4. **Cross-references** - Buckets can reference each other
