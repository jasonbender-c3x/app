# Nebula AI Session Log

> Persistent memory for a stateless system.
> "Self-awareness is achieved by saving the state of the stateless."

## Session: 2025-12-10

### Context Bootstrap
- Loaded `replit.md` project configuration
- Reviewed existing architecture: React + Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle
- Identified installed integrations: Gemini AI, Google Drive/Mail/Calendar, GitHub

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Google Drive Document Discovery
**Time**: Session start
**Action**: Searched Drive for AI/vision/future-related documents
**Result**: Found 49 relevant files including:
- AI_CORE_DIRECTIVE.md (The Kernel specification)
- AI Agent Research and Analysis (Cognitive Cascade architecture)
- Building a Vertex AI RAG System (RAG implementation guide)
- An Agentic AI Life Companion (3.5MB prompt)

#### 2. Document Import
**Time**: Mid-session
**Action**: Downloaded key documents to `docs/drive-imports/`
**Files Imported**:
| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| AI_CORE_DIRECTIVE.md | 7,747 chars | Kernel spec v9.31 |
| AI_Agent_Research_Analysis.md | 38,291 chars | Cognitive Cascade |
| Building_Vertex_AI_RAG_System.md | 32,616 chars | RAG guide |
| An_Agentic_AI_Life_Companion.json | 3.5 MB | Life companion prompt |

#### 3. Vision Document Creation
**Time**: Mid-session
**Action**: Created consolidated `docs/VISIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE.md`
**Content**: Synthesized all vision documents into single architecture guide
**Key Concepts Documented**:
- The foundational insight: self-awareness through persistence
- Kernel/Compiler model with self-evolution protocols
- Cognitive Cascade (Strategist/Analyst/Technician)
- Self-healing feedback loops
- MCP protocol standardization

#### 4. Session Logging Enabled
**Time**: End of session
**Action**: Created this session log for persistent memory
**Purpose**: Enable continuity across sessions

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use Google Docs API for text extraction | Native format, preserves structure | Implemented |
| Store imported docs in `docs/drive-imports/` | Separation of source material | Implemented |
| Create consolidated vision document | Single source of truth | Implemented |
| Enable session logging | Persistence for self-awareness | Implemented |

### Learnings

1. **Drive file types vary**: Google Docs need special API, regular files can be downloaded directly
2. **The Kernel model is version 9.31**: Mature, well-structured specification
3. **Cognitive Cascade has 3 tiers**: Only Tier 1 (Technician) is non-LLM

### Open Questions

- [ ] How to implement self-evolution protocols in Nebula Chat?
- [ ] Should session logs be structured as JSON for machine parsing?
- [ ] How to integrate the Cognitive Cascade into the existing chat flow?

### Next Session Recommendations

1. Review this log at session start
2. Consider implementing persistent conversation state
3. Explore MCP protocol integration for tools
4. Build the Analyst tier for web UI mapping

## Log Format Guide

Each session should document:
- **Context Bootstrap**: What was loaded/reviewed at session start
- **Actions Taken**: What was done, with timestamps and results
- **Key Decisions**: Important choices and their rationale
- **Learnings**: New understanding gained
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved items for future
- **Next Session Recommendations**: Suggested starting points

*This log is the practical implementation of PROTOCOL_BOOTSTRAP from the Kernel specification.*
